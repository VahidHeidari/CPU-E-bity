# Introduction

This repository contains 4-bit CPU design files for my Computer Architecture
Lab.


CPU E-bity means 4-bit CPU in Persian. E stands for number 4
(![Arabic 4](Images/Arabic-4.jpg?raw=true "Arabic 4")), because I think the E
letter is the most similar letter to number 4 in Arabic font :)
